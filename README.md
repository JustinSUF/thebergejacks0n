## THIS GAME IS VERY INCOMPLETE
Currently all you have is a very basic player controller with a character texture made by me with a few things here and there.

## what is this game about?
This is Jacks0n. A story about a 14 y/o boy who is secretly an Android developed by the company, Proton. In this world, Androids are everywhere. Most of them are known as “Maidroids”. Recently, some androids started to go against their program and gain consciousness. A lot of androids have been fighting against humans, tearing apart the world piece by piece in order to get independence. 
But this game is about Jackson, who is our main character in this world. A KineticKid 782 Android who has the intelligence and body of a 14 y/o boy. He started off as the “kid” of a human. But this human was very abusive towards Jackson and the maidroid that was also owned by the human. One day, Jackson was told to go to the park on his own. 2 hours later after he returned, his home was burned down and found no remains of his Human or the Maidroid. 
In this story, we get to see the world through his eyes with the war between androids and humans, trying to live life as a human, and much more. He’ll be forced to face multiple challenges which are completely unknown to him.
